# My web applications <img src="https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/shiny.png" width=100 align="right" /> <img src="http://www.unixstickers.com/image/cache/data/stickers/flask/Flask-text.sh-180x180.png" width=100 align="right" />

This repo contains source code and infrastructure for deploying [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) (e.g. [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny), [fiery](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fiery), and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)) via [shinyproxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/). 

## Run a single application

Each app has it's own [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, as well as a [image tag on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cpsievert/shiny_apps/builds/), so you can run individual apps like so:

```shell
docker run -p 3838:3838 cpsievert/apps:shiny-zikar
```

If you open your browser to <http://localhost:3838>, you'll see the [zikar (shiny) app]() running locally on your machine. If you'd like to run a different app, you can get the image tag from the [`application.yml`](https://github.com/cpsievert/apps/blob/master/application.yml) file.

## Run all the applications
